## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

**PharmAlchemy** is a data integration project focused on cleaning, standardizing, and linking biomedical data across four key public datasets:

- **DisGeNET** (geneâ€“disease and drugâ€“disease associations)
- **DrugBank** (drugâ€“protein targets)
- **STRING** (geneâ€“protein relationships)
- **SIDER** (drug side effects)

The goal is to enable **interoperable querying** across these datasets using a **unified ontology schema** to support **drug discovery and bioinformatics research**.
